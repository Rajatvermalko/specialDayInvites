          Hii....my special one ❣️
How can I tell you all.... I was little nervous,but when we met for the first time, i felt very really comfortable when I interacted with you, then our journey started and we both started talking to each other, and from there on I'm always excited to listen to you and talking to you.. it feels like a dream to me.. then our second meeting happened where you held my hand for the first time, I got butterflies in my stomach, It felt so special... After spending some time with you, I always smile when I think about our conversations😍... I just wanna say I love you❣️ so much ever and forever... your voice, your smile, your presence.. I love everything about you.. In my eyes you are totally perfect for me❤️. The most beautiful chapter of my life written by God is when he sent you in my life.....🥳❣️ aur ha aapse ladai kiye bina, aapse gussa hue bina, aapse baat kiye bina, aapko pareshan kiye bina mera din complete nhi hota... 😘

          Hey beautiful😘... It was sunday evening when i met you, the moment i saw you i thought she's nice, looks cute. But when we had our conversation on the same day i got to know a litter more about you. It felt so special 💞, something in mind and heart just clicked.The way we started our conversation, it felt like we knew each other. Then and at that moment magic happened 😍.
Since that we our bond got stronger and stronger 💪.
We're at a stage where we trust each other, we love each other and we cherish the time spent together💓.Earlier when i didn't met her, i didn't believe in love, but now i do, she made me fall for her💕. Yes, she irritates me, but in exchange i tease her all day, our relationship is more than just normal couple,we are best friends, we are old married couple and we are also teenagers who have on each other..... That too all at once😉💞. Atlast i just want to confess my love for you my sweetheart 😘. Love you so so much.. And my love and affection for you will keep growing 💞😍.
